#CryptoAPIs

#Crypto APIs is a complex and innovative infrastructure layer that radically simplifies the development of any Blockchain and Crypto related applications. Organized around REST, Crypto APIs can assist both novice Bitcoin/Ethereum enthusiasts and crypto experts with the development of their blockchain applications. Crypto APIs provides unified endpoints and data, raw data, automatic tokens and coins forwardings, callback functionalities, and much more.

  # Create Automatic Coins Forwarding
  # Through this endpoint customers can set up an automatic forwarding function specifically for coins (**not** tokens). They can have a &#x60;toAddress&#x60; which is essentially the main address and the destination for the automatic coins forwarding.     There is also a &#x60;minimumTransferAmount&#x60; which only when reached will then trigger the forwarding. Through this the customer can save from fees.    Moreover, &#x60;feePriority&#x60; can be also set,  which defines how quickly to move the coins once they are received. The higher priority, the larger the fee will be. It can be \&quot;SLOW\&quot;, \&quot;STANDARD\&quot; or \&quot;FAST\&quot;.    The response of this endpoint contains an attribute &#x60;fromAddress&#x60; which can be used as a deposit address. Any funds received by this address will be automatically forwarded to &#x60;toAddress&#x60; based on what the customer has set for the automation.    For this automatic forwarding the customer can set a callback subscription.    {warning}The subscription will work for all incoming transactions until it is deleted. There is no need to do that for every transaction.{/warning}    {note}This endpoint generates a new &#x60;fromAddress&#x60; each time.{/note}

  # Delete Automatic Coins Forwarding
  # Through this endpoint customers can delete a forwarding function they have set for **coins** (**not** tokens).    By setting a &#x60;fromAddress&#x60; and a &#x60;toAddress&#x60;, and specifying the amount, coins can be transferred between addresses.     A &#x60;feePriority&#x60; will be returned which represents the fee priority of the automation whether it is \&quot;SLOW\&quot;, \&quot;STANDARD\&quot; OR \&quot;FAST\&quot;.    {warning}The subscription will work for all incoming transactions until it is deleted. There is no need to do that for every transaction.{/warning}

  # List Coins Forwarding Automations
  # Through this endpoint customers can list all of their **coins** forwarding automations (**not** tokens).
