  # List Supported Assets
  # This endpoint will return a list of supported assets. The asset could be a cryptocurrency or FIAT assets that we support. Each asset has a unique identifier - &#x60;assetId&#x60; and a unique symbol in the form of a string, e.g. \&quot;BTC\&quot;.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :context In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. &#x60;context&#x60; is specified by the user.
  # @option opts [String] :asset_type Defines the type of the supported asset. This could be either \&quot;crypto\&quot; or \&quot;fiat\&quot;.
  # @option opts [Integer] :limit Defines how many items should be returned in the response per page basis.
  # @option opts [Integer] :offset The starting index of the response items, i.e. where the response should start listing the returned items.
  # @return [ListSupportedAssetsR]
