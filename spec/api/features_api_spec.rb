  # unit tests for broadcast_locally_signed_transaction
  # Broadcast Locally Signed Transaction
  # Through this endpoint customers can broadcast transactions that have been already signed locally. Instead of using a node for broadcasting a signed transaction users can use this endpoint. We then keep the user posted about the status by sending you a callback with a success or failure status.    {warning}This can be prepared and signed **only** locally, not through the API. We can provide support only for the process of broadcasting.{/warning}
