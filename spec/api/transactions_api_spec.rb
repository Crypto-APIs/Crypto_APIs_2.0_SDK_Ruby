#CryptoAPIs

#Crypto APIs 2.0 is a complex and innovative infrastructure layer that radically simplifies the development of any Blockchain and Crypto related applications. Organized around REST, Crypto APIs 2.0 can assist both novice Bitcoin/Ethereum enthusiasts and crypto experts with the development of their blockchain applications. Crypto APIs 2.0 provides unified endpoints and data, raw data, automatic tokens and coins forwardings, callback functionalities, and much more.

  # unit tests for create_coins_transaction_request_from_address
  # Create Coins Transaction Request from Address
  # Through this endpoint users can create a new single transaction request from one address to another.
  # @param address Defines the specific source address for the transaction.
  # @param blockchain Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.
  # @param network Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \&quot;mainnet\&quot; is the live network with actual data while networks like \&quot;testnet\&quot;, \&quot;ropsten\&quot;, \&quot;rinkeby\&quot; are test networks.
  # @param wallet_id Represents the sender&#39;s specific and unique Wallet ID of the sender.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :context In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. &#x60;context&#x60; is specified by the user.

  # Create Coins Transaction Request from Wallet
  # Through this endpoint users can create a new transaction request from the entire Wallet instead from just a specific address.

  # unit tests for create_tokens_transaction_request_from_address
  # Create Tokens Transaction Request from Address
  # Through this endpoint users can make a single token transaction.    {warning}This applies only to **fungible** tokens, **not** NFTs (non-fungible tokens).{/warning}    {note}To have an operational callback subscription, you need to first verify a domain for the Callback URL. Please see more information on Callbacks [here](https://developers.cryptoapis.io/technical-documentation/general-information/callbacks#callback-url).{/note}    {warning}Crypto APIs will notify the user **only when** the event occurs. There are cases when the specific event doesn&#39;t happen at all, or takes a long time to do so. A callback notification **will not** be sent if the event does not or cannot occur, or will take long time to occur.{/warning}
