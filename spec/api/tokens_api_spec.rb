#CryptoAPIs

#Crypto APIs 2.0 is a complex and innovative infrastructure layer that radically simplifies the development of any Blockchain and Crypto related applications. Organized around REST, Crypto APIs 2.0 can assist both novice Bitcoin/Ethereum enthusiasts and crypto experts with the development of their blockchain applications. Crypto APIs 2.0 provides unified endpoints and data, raw data, automatic tokens and coins forwardings, callback functionalities, and much more.

  # unit tests for list_tokens_by_address
  # List Tokens By Address
  # Through this endpoint customers can obtain token data by providing an attribute - &#x60;address&#x60;.  The information that can be returned can include the contract address, the token symbol, type and balance.
  # @param blockchain Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, etc.
  # @param network Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \&quot;mainnet\&quot; is the live network with actual data while networks like \&quot;ropsten\&quot;, \&quot;rinkeby\&quot; are test networks.
  # @param address Represents the public address, which is a compressed and shortened form of a public key.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :context In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. &#x60;context&#x60; is specified by the user.
  # @option opts [Integer] :limit Defines how many items should be returned in the response per page basis.
  # @option opts [Integer] :offset The starting index of the response items, i.e. where the response should start listing the returned items.
  # @return [ListTokensByAddressResponse]
